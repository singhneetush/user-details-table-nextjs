### Code Explanation

#### 1. **SignUpForm** (User Registration):

The **SignUpForm** component handles user registration with input fields for name, email, password, and confirm password. It validates the user input and stores the new user data in `localStorage` upon successful registration.

#### 2. **LoginForm** (User Login):

The **LoginForm** component allows users to log in by entering their email and password. If the user exists in `localStorage`, they are logged in and redirected to the items page.

#### 3. **ItemsPage** (Post Listing with Search and Pagination):

The **ItemsPage** fetches a list of posts from a public API and displays them in a table format. The table supports search (by title or ID) and pagination (10 posts per page). It also shows the logged-in user's name.

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling, which allows for utility-first, responsive layouts.
- Custom components such as buttons, cards, and inputs are built using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.
- Additional styling features include hover effects, responsive layouts, and error messages for form validation.

## Usage

1. **Sign up**:
   - Go to the sign-up page (`/sign-up`), and create an account by providing a name, email, and password.
2. **Login**:

   - After signing up, go to the login page (`/login`) and log in with your credentials.
   - Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the items page (`/items`), where you can view a list of posts and search through them.

3. **Post Search**:

   - Use the search bar to filter posts by title or ID.
   - You can clear the search input by clicking the "X" icon.

4. **Pagination**:
   - Navigate through the paginated list of posts using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
5. **Logout**:
   - Click the logout button to clear the logged-in user data from `localStorage` and redirect back to the login page.
